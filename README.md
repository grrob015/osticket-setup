# osticket-setup
Setting up osTicket, a free, open source IT helpdesk platform.

## Creating our osTicket host

We will be hosting our osTicket helpdesk on a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure, so we will need to do the following:
1. Create a resource group to hold all of our osTicket-related resources.
2. Create a Windows 10 virtual machine inside the resoucre group.
3. Log into the Windows 10 virtual machine with a remote desktop application.

If you don't know how to do part or all of this list, I made an [Azure Basics](https://github.com/grrob015/azure-basics) tutorial that covers these topics. Once inside your VM, open this repository up and download
